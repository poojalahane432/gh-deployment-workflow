# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This repository demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages. 

## How It Works
- The workflow automatically deploys the `index.html` file to GitHub Pages when changes are made.
- It only triggers if `index.html` is modified in the main branch.
- The site will be accessible at: `https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/`

## Setup
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings.
2. Push changes to the main branch.
3. GitHub Actions will handle the deployment.
